# R_helperfunctions
series of helper functions I use, mostly a set of snippets for others to borrow from


RtoAfni_helper.R - small set of wrapper functions, used to drive AFNI commands in R via system calls

geo_utitilites - set of functions used to compute distances/destinations between points, given lattitude and longitude
